# open-services
This repository serves as the basis for the website explaining and defining Open Services.

## What is a service?
A service is an application which can be a frontend or backend that serves a purpose for a user or additional applications needs.

## What is an open service?
An open service is the idea that a service is developed, maintained, released, and enhanced in the open. This allows for a community to be created by end users moving the the project forward. This openness allows for the community to resolve security vulnerabilites, make requests for features, and generate new features through PRs.

## Why use this framework?
This framework will help to answer questions in regards to architecture, operations, monitoring, community engagement, and many more. By defining this framework we hope to bring forward those practices that have benefitted Red Hat productization to end users, customers, internal Red Hat development teams, and external developers to help remove the complexity around the deployment of a mature service.
